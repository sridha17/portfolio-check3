            Most of the photographs were either from a preservation area or nature reserve. I find that it is essential to 
            arrive on-location in the morning for the most shots; animals are able to enjoy the sunlight without overheating.
             As the day continues, they typically retreat away from view or rest/move less. 
        </p>

             One image in this gallery that I would like to highlight on is of the Cheetah family, taken at the St. Louis Zoo. There 
             was news of an adult female that became pregnant and that her cubs would be delivered within the Zoo's facilities. I was able 
             to gain early photography access to visit the closed enclosure and take shots of the cubs once they were released from the 
             facility. At first, I was surprised - the cubs were already getting big even though they were only a few months old. This
              was a particulary fun shoot because of the number of subjects and the amount of action. The cubs were playful and made 
              for more dynamic motion shots (until then, most of the wildlife shots had included the subject in a sitting/lounging position) 
              and I was able to spend a good amount of time with them. To this day it remains one of my favorite shoots.
        </p>
        <p>All wildlife shots were taken on a Canon 7D Mark II. F-stop settings for these range from f/5.6 to f/8 
            to ensure a shallow depth of field and additional focus on the animal subject. Essentially, there are taken in a
            "portrait mode" to depict the full animal in the shot. As for the editing of these photographs, it is important
            to showcase texture and the realism of the shot. With close up shots, I like to use a telephoto lens in order to 
            achieve the maximum detail possible. When coloring pictures, I have found that vibrant wildlife pictures are appealing
            and like to capture my subjects in elevated, natural lighting as opposed to later in the day.
