        <p>Landscape photography is a versatile and fun form of photography. Each location, each destination 
            provides for a completely different change in scenery. One of my personal favorites on this page is
            of Multnomah Falls, located in Portland, OR. I prefer to shoot in overcast weather, and Portland's
            scenery provided this beautiful contrast between the hazy atmosphere with the bright-green foreground
            and foliage. A lot of my landscape photography composes of playing with light-and-dark; the image of
            the Hawa Mahal at dusk exemplifies this notion, where I was able to capture both the illumination of 
            the monument's struction and the shadows cast behind it.
        </p>
        <p>Most of the landscape photographs were taken on a Canon T5i and taken
            midday. Lower shutterspeed were used for stationary landscapes, but typically
            increased when non-stationary elements (this includes flowing water, trees blowing in the wind)
            were present. ISO's typically range from 100 to 200 for these shots. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When editing landsape images, I try to balance the lighting present in the photograph so as to increase the saturation without
            causing the image to look artificial. As seen in the Grand Canyon image in on the homepage, some
            landscape photograph involves a manual stitching of two or more images so as to encapsulate the breadth
            of the landscape.    
        </p>
