        <p>As depicted in this gallery, most of my motion shots are aviation-based. There used to be an annual air show hosted
            in St. Louis, where the majority of the photographs were taken. Some also come from shows at Scott Air Force Base,
            which is nearby. Typically, there will be an area from which photographers are designated to take their shots and 
            allows us to get nearer to the planes than the general public. 
        </p>
        <p>A personal favorite of mine are the shots where multiple
            planes are flying in a formation (ex: the Red Arrows Team); these can be tricky as sometimes planes overlap and become difficult 
            to distinguish, especially since they are all uniform in appearance. Another shot which was more tricky to time was of the 
            F-22 and the P-51, in which both planes where flying towards each other and captured in the same frame; these shots require
            a much higher shutterspeed and greater aperture to ensure that one of the many shots taken in the 1 second time span that
            they are within the same frame with contain both of them.
        </p>
        <p>Motion shots, especially aviation shots, were mainly taken on a Canon 7D Mark II. Most motion shots require a greater
            shutterspeed and lower f-stop. It is important in these shots that there is enough contrast between the foreground and
            background; sometimes edges of the subject can become blurred with the sky. In the process of caputuring especially quick
            cases, edges and lines can become blurry or lose resolution. Editing allows me to sharpen areas of the image that would
            otherwise not be as clear, and improve the overall quality of the image.
        </p>
